## Description
ENI wishes to develop a web platform for its active trainees and former trainees, allowing them to organize outings. The platform is private, and registration will be managed by the administrator(s). Outings and participants are linked to a campus to facilitate geographical organization of events.

## Problem
The large number of trainees and their distribution across different campuses make it difficult to organize events or outings. The identified issues are:
- There is no official communication channel to propose or consult outings.
- Current tools do not allow managing invitations based on trainees' geographical location or interests, nor managing the number of guests or the registration deadline.

A successful solution would allow the organization of these outings and anticipate the number of participants, the location of the outing, and other necessary information for the smooth running of the activity.

## Objective
To set up a web platform for trainees in training and former trainees that allows organizing outings during off-training time.
